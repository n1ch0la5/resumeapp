<h1>Resume Writing Tips</h1>
<p>Resumes aren’t just requirements for job applications. They’re the story of your career. Here are some tips that can help you tell that story the best way possible.</p>
<h2>How Should My Resume Look?</h2>
<p>It goes without saying that your resume should be attractive, but what that means may be different depending on the job you’re applying for. Start with the basics:</p>
<h3>Choose a clean, professional font. That doesn’t always mean your default font in Word.</h3>
<p>Many people just stick with the default font in their document creation program and go to work crafting their resumes. That usually means Cambria or Times New Roman.</p>
<p>Try to think in terms of modern, lighter typefaces. Georgia, Gill Sans, Helvetica, Verdana – all are easy to read in print and online, and can give a break to the eyes of a recruiter who’s spent the last hour reading 60 resumes in Times. And that’s to your advantage.</p>
<p>Also, try to stay at an 11-point font size or above throughout your resume.</p>
<h3>Build your resume for "scannability."</h3>
<p>As much as we’d like to believe recruiters are poring over every word we place in front of them, odds are, they’re giving your resume a quick initial glance at first, looking for a reason to dig deeper. That means resumes that allow the eye to move freely across them – while still communicating relevant information about a candidate – will stand a better chance of earning a longer look.</p>
<p>Break your content into similar size chunks where possible, and don’t overload a particular section. Large blocks of text can be off-putting to a scanner.</p>
<p>Use clear delineations to indicate a new piece of your career history. This may be as simple as bolding the job titles throughout your resume, using a slightly larger point size for these titles, or using a horizontal line rule to indicate a break.</p>
<h3>Be Careful With Color</h3>
<p>For most job applications, adding a lot of color to your resume probably isn’t a risk worth taking. The notable exceptions are jobs for which design and visual communication skills are among the foremost qualifications. Usually, this will be very clear in the job description. However, if you’re applying for a job at a bank, and think your resume will stand out if you add some flairs of color, you may be right…in all the wrong ways.</p>
<p>Color could be relegated to web links, an appropriately sized headshot, or subtle design elements within your resume – bullet points, lines, etc. But even then, remember, the idea is to enhance, not distract. Choose colors that are easy to view on a screen or in print, and avoid bright, bold colors that could draw attention away from your content.</p>
<h2>What Should my Resume Say?</h2>
<p>Ask a dozen different people, and you’ll get a dozen different answers. Resumes are high-stakes pieces. We’re talking about the document that can earn you your next paycheck, after all. So it’s easy to over-think and become overwhelmed before you even start.</p>
<p>Don’t worry. If you can nail down an approach to writing a resume, it becomes much more manageable:</p>
<h3>Start by asking, "What do I need employers to know about me?"</h3>
<p>Think high-level. What are the professional attributes you exhibit on a daily basis? What three or four words would summarize your career track to this point? Many successful job candidates combine descriptions of professional attributes and a career recap phrase into a summary statement at the top of the resume. This is optional, of course, but it can help an employer get a sense for you as a candidate – and an employee – if done well. </p>
<p>For example, a candidate for a public relations position may say something like, “Dependable, conscientious professional with strong experience in media relations and journalism.” It may seem difficult at first to boil down your career to a dozen words or so, but the strongest resumes communicate without excess.</p>
<h3>Read the job description thoroughly.</h3>
<p>It sounds obvious. But employers would be quick to tell you that one of the quickest ways to eliminate your candidacy is to present a resume with qualifications that have little to do with a given job listing. When that happens, recruiters often assume that the candidate is spamming the job boards with their resume, hoping that something will stick. That’s a poor strategy to take as an applicant, and will ultimately result in a lot of wasted effort.</p>
<p>Read the job description, word for word, several times to make sure it’s something that matches your skills and qualifications. Consider editing your resume to use some of the key words and phrases that are in the listing, if they describe elements of your career accurately. </p>
<h3>Focus your resume on accomplishments, not duties</h3>
<p>Successful candidates usually have a resume that tells about how they improved their workplace, not just what they did on a day-to-day basis. The daily activities of a given job should yield results that show your value as an employee. One way to think about this is a cause-and-effect relationship. Your day-to-day duties are the causes, the end result are the effects. Employers are more interested in the effects.</p>
<p>For example, if you were a project manager at a large company, chances are listing that job title will give a recruiter a pretty good idea of what you did each day. You managed deadlines, oversaw budgets, and perhaps interfaced with a cross-functional team at the company. It’s more attractive to recruiters to know that as a result of your work, the company brought several products to market ahead of schedule, resulting unforeseen gains in the fiscal year.</p>
<p>Don’t stop at telling potential employers what you did; tell them what it meant.</p>
<h3>Don’t overwrite</h3>
<p>Resumes are professional pieces of communication, of course, but that doesn’t mean employers are looking Pulitzer-winning material. In fact, the simpler the writing style, the better, in most cases.</p>
<p>Applicants often falsely assume that throwing a dozen 25-word sentences into their resume will make them appear more professional. Unless you’re an extremely gifted writer, it won’t. Remember, usually your resume is one of many submitted for a given position. Let the other applicants enter resumes that are a chore to read. Keep yours concise and to the point. Use words that you’d use in everyday (professional) conversation. Try to avoid industry-specific jargon. Pretend you’re describing your career to an intelligent friend over coffee.</p>
<h3>Tell a story about your personal "brand"</h3>
<p>Think back to your professional attributes and career summary phrases. Are these evident throughout your resume? The most effective resumes are able to show a career progression that hits on consistent themes about an applicant. Some call this a personal “brand”, the things for which people can depend on you in a professional setting.</p>
<h2>Common Questions</h2>
<h3>How long should my resume be?</h3>
<p>It will depend on how long you’ve been working, of course, but as a general rule, try to keep your resume to a maximum of two pages. One page – with a concise but impactful work history – is probably better. This may require careful editing to cut out day-to-day duties in favor of results achieved at your various jobs. But that’s for the better.</p>
<h3>Should I include references in my resume?</h3>
<p>Often, the answer to this is found in the job listing, as many will specify whether you are to include references in your application. Companies using an online system for their application process (and many do these days) will usually have a section in which you can provide references.</p>
<p>So, in general, it may be preferable to leave references off your resume for now, especially if you’re worried about space. However, you should indicate in your job application that you are able to provide references upon request, if they are not specifically asked for in the job listing.</p>
<h3>Who should I use as references?</h3>
<p>References fall into two broad categories: professional and personal. Most job applications ask for professional references, though some will ask for personal, especially if the job opening requires strong interpersonal skills. </p>
<p>The best professional references are those who have held supervisory roles over you in your career. It doesn’t have to be the company CEO; in fact, often your direct supervisor is better equipped to give information about your performance as an employee. Co-workers who worked with you can be great sources of information about your skills and your ability to work as a member of a team. Also, consider looking at people who work at other companies that do business with your organization. Maintaining effective B-to-B relationships are important for many companies, and showcasing your experience in doing this may be beneficial. Always ask before listing someone as a professional reference, and avoid asking people with whom you did not leave on good terms.</p>
<p>Personal references are usually individuals outside of work with whom you’ve maintained an active, recent relationship. They are not family members. They are people who can speak to your personality and character based on first-hand experience. If you’ve been out of college a while, hitting up your fraternity brother with whom you haven’t spoken in seven years probably isn’t a good idea. Think more along the lines of people you’ve met through your child’s school, a church group, or other social setting.</p>
<h3>In what order should I put the information on my resume?</h3>
<p>It’s largely a matter of personal preference. After your name and contact information, a general expectation is to list your most recent job first, and work in reverse chronological order from there. Education and references (if included at all) usually come last. </p>
<p>Some applicants list their education before their work history, or give a brief summary of their experience or a career summary statement at the top. Summaries can improve scannability by grouping relevant information at the top.</p>
<h3>Should I include non-paid or volunteer work in my resume?</h3>
<p>If the position has made a noticeable impact on the community, then yes, by all means. Employers look very favorably on employees who demonstrate community involvement – it’s built-in positive PR for them, and it shows that the employee is rooted in the area. If you’re a new job seeker, internships or volunteer opportunities may be a good portion of your work history. Recruiters understand this, but it means you may have to work harder to show the results of your work, not just list the day-to-day duties.</p>
<h3>How do I show time I was out of work on my resume?</h3>
<p>If there is a hole in your work history, it’s usually best addressed in a cover letter or other communication, not your resume. Remember, resumes are about what you’ve accomplished. Use the valuable space on your resume to put your best foot forward. Many times, companies with an online application system will ask you to account for time out of work anyway, so there’s no need to place this on a resume.</p>
